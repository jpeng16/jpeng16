## Hi, I'm Jasmine ! 👋 

I'm a current Master's student in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (expected to graduate in December 2025 😄). I come from a background of software testing, but my passion for creating and making things led me to pursue a master's where I can challenge myself to code and create cool projects myself. 

## My Interests
💻 Machine learning
🌐 Web and Mobile Development
🧘‍♂️ Yoga and Pilates
📺 Keeping up with TV Shows/Movies
🎨 Arts and Crafts
🔭 Currently working on curriculum provided by the Odin Project!
