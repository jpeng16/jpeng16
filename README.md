# Hi, I'm Jasmine ! 

I'm a current Master's student in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (expected to graduate in December 2025). I come from a background of software testing, but my passion for learning and creating things led me to pursue a master's where I can challenge myself to explore new technologies and create interesting projects.
